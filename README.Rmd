# inequality

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of \`\`inequality'' is to provide users with a inequality analysis toolkit based on Lorenz curves and Gini coefficient. The traditional case of analysis of a single resource, e.g., income or wealth, is included. The multivariate extension based on Fan et al. (?) is also supported. Most functions support weighted samples.

## Examples of Relevant Multivariate Distributions

-   Multivariate Lognormal

-   Multivariate Pareto

-   Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern Family with uniform marginals

-   Sarmanov-Lee

## S-Gini

$$
G_\delta = 1 - \frac{2^{d-1}}{\sum_{j=1}^d \delta_j^{-1}}\sum_{k=1}^d \int_{[0,1]^d} Q_k(u_1,\dots,u_d) \left(1 - u_k\right)^{\delta_k - 1} \prod_{j\neq k}^d \left(1 - u_j\right) \, du_1\dots du_d 
$$
