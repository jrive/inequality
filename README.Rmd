# inequality

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ``inequality'' is to provide users with a inequality analysis toolkit based on Lorenz curves and Gini coefficient. The traditional case of analysis of a single resource, e.g., income or wealth, is included. The multivariate extension based on Fan et al. (?) is also supported. Most functions support weighted samples.
