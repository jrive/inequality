# inequality

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of \`\`inequality’’ is to provide users with a inequality
analysis toolkit based on Lorenz curves and Gini coefficient. The
traditional case of analysis of a single resource, e.g., income or
wealth, is included. The multivariate extension based on Fan et al. (?)
is also supported. Most functions support weighted samples.
